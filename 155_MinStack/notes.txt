The min stack is so fucking cool. I have heard that
programs use a stack as a method for 'undoing' an action
or a playlist functionality.

This feels sorta similar, but instead its keeping track of
what the min value was in time. 

Im not sure if saving them seperatly in two different stacks
is that much slower over saving them as a tupple in the same stack.
