I remember really struggling to implement binary search before
but I did not really struggle at all this time. Its a lot
easier if you first think it out and visualize it on paper.

I just remembered this,
Java's implementation for BinarySearch had a bug that went unnoticed
for 9 years

I of course also commited the same mistake LOL. Writting bug-free code is so
hard.
