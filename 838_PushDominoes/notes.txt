I have the second slowest solution of the bunch. The majority is at 6ms, mine is 22ms.
The slowest is 1,187ms, why is this solution that much slower than mine?.

Honestly thought my solution would be alot slower.
Very clever algorithm is needed to be fast.

What is the time complexity?

Worst case is O(n^2)?
