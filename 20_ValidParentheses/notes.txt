Because I solved the previous 2 linked list problems
in C, decided to comeback to an old problem that I solved
using a stack but implement it using a liked list.

Also thinking of redoing this but instead of using a linked list,
use a dynamic array instead.

Not leaking memory is so hard.

I know C is much faster but comparing performace with
my other python/ruby solution is so funny

┌──────────┬────────┬──────────┐
│                      │ speed       │ memory         │
├──────────┼────────┼──────────┤
│ C (linkedList) │ 3ms         │ 8.5mb           │
│ C (dyn array) │ 0ms         │ 8.05mb          │
│ python           │ 39ms      │ 16.48mb       │
│ ruby              │ 63ms       │ 211.04mb     │
└──────────┴────────┴──────────┘

I am super happy with my dynamic array implementation and solution, and it so much more
faster. Reallocating buffers is alot faster than manipulating pointers?

That was so much fun.

I also dont think we should be so afraid of using `goto` statements

I might learn flutter so I decided to learn some dart by revisiting easy leetcode problems.
