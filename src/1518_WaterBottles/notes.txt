I knew this problem was perfect for solving with recursion.
Reassigning emptyBottles, numBottles, drank is much more readable
to do
emptyBottles += numBottles
..
..
return drinking(...)

but i just thought it would look cooler to do it in inline.

on line where
```
} else if emptyBottles >= numExchange {...
```

being able to reference numExchange, that is thanks to closures. neat!

does go do TCO? It appears that scala and elixir support do.

I thought my solution was clever, you could have solved it in
O(1) space and time, with simple math........
