felt kinda bad for the first solution
so i thought using a hashmap to count how many times 
a letter appears in strings would be faster

looking at solutions i found this very cleaver and 
beatifull solution

def is_anagram(s, t)
  return false unless s.length == t.length

  ('a'..'z').each { |c| return false if s.count(c) != t.count(c) }

  true
end
