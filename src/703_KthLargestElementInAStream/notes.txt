The naive solution was exceeding the time limit until i sorted the
initial array (8020ms).
Then decided to sort everytime you add a value lowers it down to (1559ms),
my guess the intepreter has an easier sorting?

 but its still too slow.

In binary search, we know the datastructure is sorted so its very quick to find
the data, maybe there is a similar data structure for adding in a data but we
also want to get the 'kth' biggest item.
