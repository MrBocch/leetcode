doing this is kinda funny

> while (cache contains ptr.x) 

also, you can only do this because if
you actually read it.
- The input is generated such that there is at least one
  node in the linked list that has a value not present in nums

so cache.contains(ptr.x), will never throw a exception.

cool that you can write functionally
in scala, but you could also do this
if you wanted.
