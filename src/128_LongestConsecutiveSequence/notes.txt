This one really trips me up.
You are still looping over the nums twice but
the look up is O(1) so its not O(n^2).

Also for some reason you have to iterate over the
hash instead of the nums,

i guess its faster if you dont
have to go over any duplicates???, its not that much work is it?

Dont understand why it would be an issue?

I remember reading in The Algorithm Design Manual 
in sorting chapter, that some problems become trivial
once data is sorted. This is one.

I just dont understand why looping over
for n in nums:
# exceeds the time limit 
# over
for n in lookup:

I guess if its a really large set with
one very big sequence like 0 -> 9999999999999
[0..9999999, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0(one million times)]
It would redo that sequence a million times when
we already know the answer, no need. Ok I get it
