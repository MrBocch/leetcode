what is the time complexity of recursive solution?
It feels like it should be slow but
"The number of nodes in three is in the range [0, 10^5]"
I guess its O(n), but in space, I imagine it just blows up.

What if you dont have to traverse the entire tree? 
just return early.

thats the iterative solution but, im a silly guy. If im doing it iteratively
I should not be calling a depth function, I should fully write it to be itterative.
If you were to do it iteratively, would I have to slices, and switch over
back and forth?, also have to zero out the slices. 

also, they are called
Depth First Search, Breath First Search.
