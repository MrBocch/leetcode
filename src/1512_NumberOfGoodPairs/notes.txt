Took advantage of the fact that the constraints are
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
and using a bruteforce solution in this case is ok.

What would a not bruteforce solution look like?
is another type of solution possible?

counting frequency of each number?

I would have not been able to solve this if it were not for the 
formula in the hint

i was going to naively, divide by 2 the amount of times a number appears
but this does not take into account that, i need to count the pairs, 
the number that is in one pair could belong to another pair

n * (n â€“ 1) // 2
