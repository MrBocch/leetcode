It has occured to me that i could sort the list, then check one by one 
if element is equal to its neighbor, although its slower than my other 
solutions, i think its interesting. The advantage it has over my first 
solution is that it, uses less space, sorting the array in place instead
of creating a hashmap 


I had not idea .tally() was thing, "This is so convinient i might would of liked
to know sooner"

looking at this for whatever reason.
You could tell i was just learning ruby

would replace the tally with
	nums.tally.any?{|k,v| v>1}
