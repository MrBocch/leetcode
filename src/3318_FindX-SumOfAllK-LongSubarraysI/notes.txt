This is what you call, write once, never read again lol.

How would you do this in go?

You slide window, but every time you slide, don't create a
new hashmap over and over, just remove the old item, and add the new item.

Also, instead of using a hashmap to keep tally, what if instead you used
a heap, to track what is the most frequent K item?

Have no experience with heaps, should come back to this.
(rewrite in Go using a heap)
