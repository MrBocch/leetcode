I imagine one is ment to manipulate the Node->next
to point to another node, but it seems so much more complicated
than just overriding the things.

time complexity: O(2n) -> O(n)
space complexity: O(n)

Now that im thinking about it, its the same as reversing
the linked list from before, but at the end we take one more step.

This step is, the first node points to the node that goes after
the last node, and the previous node from the left points to the node
of the last.

ez enough right?

I cut these problem into, pieces
find the sublist, reverse it.
and then cut it back into where it was.

Funny edge cases that I did not consider. Managing memory and pointers its so easy
to shoot yourself.
