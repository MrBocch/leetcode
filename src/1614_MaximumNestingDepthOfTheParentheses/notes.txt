Saw this code_report video,

thought to, solve it first, then compare to
how he solved it.

Also, fun idea to use a array, to have multiple accumulators

I still think very imperatively (reduce is just state), or maybe
he is very APL'brained. I just don't think
very 'array programming oriented'.

he really transforms the data
string |> filters for '()'
       |> maps    '('-> 1;
				  ')'->-1;
       |> prefix sum
	   |> max 

Just a different way of thinking.
