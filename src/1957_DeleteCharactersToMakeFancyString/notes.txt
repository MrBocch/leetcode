The iterative python solution is really slow, I believe its
because we are += to the string meaning it must allocate a
new string right?

How much faster would it be to use a array then join them at the end?

It made very little difference, so why is it so slow?
What are others doing? They are most likely deleting in place? -> No

Maybe its me calling len() on the string over and over
I quit calling len() and it was significantly faster.
Maybe it would also be faster if you did not have to index into the list

Yeah, im lookin at a solution twice as fast as mine, they are also
avoiding new string allocations, but they are not even allocating
strings for knowing the previous 2 chars, but they use a count instead of
indexing for last to strings

To go from 535ms to 195ms using the same memory is a big deal if you
were doing this over and over.
You go faster by doing less.
