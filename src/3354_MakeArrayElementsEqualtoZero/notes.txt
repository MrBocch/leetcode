When I first saw this, i first thought of that
computerphile Busy Beaver video, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE8UhcyJS0I)
so figured that 
its impossible to calculate answer some other way
other than just simulating it.

Not true at all.

The solution is
clever and had you paid attention to
[1,1,1,0,3] is equivalent to [3,0,3]. you would have seen it.

The scala solution is so ugly LOOL. its there a
prettier way?
