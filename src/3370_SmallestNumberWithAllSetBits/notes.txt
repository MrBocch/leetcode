in haskell you could

head $ dropWhile (< n) $ map (\x -> (2**x) -1) [1..]

I like how its less verbose than scala, but i dont like you
have to read it from right to left
it would be great if it had its own pipe "|>" operator. 

In scala theres more verbosity but, you can read it left to right
how you would read a sentence. Neat, I wish to learn more about
lazy evaulations.

bitwise operations are always cool
n & (n+1) == 0
does a compiler realize to do these tricks? 

interesting way to do lazy list in elixir.
