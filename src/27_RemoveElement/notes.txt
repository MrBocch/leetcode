I found this very elegant solution that had no edge cases
band aid fixes.

Instead of n[first] == val { swap nums[first] nums[last] }

instead you traverse the list, you repeat the number that is not
the val, idk how to explain

[1, 2, 4, 3, 5] val = 4

-> [1, 2, 3, 5, 5]

Also, I think its time for me to try on harder problems instead of staying in my comfort zone
