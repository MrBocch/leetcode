Saw this in a CODE report video and thought
to solve it in
- C (brute force): O(n^2) 5ms
- C (one pass)   : O(n)   0ms
- elixir         : O(n)   0ms (but it uses alot more memory) 

then I'll go watch the video and compare

So I actually have no experience with elixir, but its the closest
to ruby so I thought it wouldn't be to hard.
If I had more experience with elixir I would probably use a reduce.

Discovering elixir has pattern matching like haskell makes me want to
checkout elixir.
