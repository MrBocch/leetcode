Isn't ruby so beautiful.

In gopherlang, I could probably do the same type of solution.

Thought what would you do to avoid the while loops and appending
 to the array which takes time if it continually reallocates over and over.
 With if expressions, code does not ugly.
 You could have also used the ternary operator. I always forget about ternary operator,
 rewrote it with ternary, it looks cleaner IMHO.
