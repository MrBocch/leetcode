This is some 'easy'. Im just bad at math.
Took a glance at it and thought, oh, this is just
take a number and convert it to base 26, as if it
you were converting it into base 16.

Not the case. I did not realize this until 2 hours
in, "THERES NO ZERO". How did I not realize this right away?

This is the problem when you race to keyboard instead of
fully observing the problem, and formulating the solution.

Even knowing this could not have solved it unless chatgpt mentioned
it in passing when I asked it
"Number system without zero"
then
"Base 26 without zero"
