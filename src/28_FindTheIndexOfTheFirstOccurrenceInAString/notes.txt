short circuit evaluation so kool, String#index will return nil if pattern
is not found.

should try without piggy backing off a standard library like ruby's

I did not know golang had this like python'esque array slicing
haystack[i:i+len(needle)] == needle
doing that is a lot simpler, its probably just as fast as what i wrote
