Learn You a Haskell For Good 
they solve this in Haskell

.rb
I dont understand why it wont work,
I know that there is something is going wrong when 
im dividing, could solve the test cases but 
one test case is soo long to check by hand what is going wrong 

could a statically typed language help here 

temp[-2].div temp[-1] does not work either 

am I doing something else wrong other than the division ????
what edgecase am i missing here ?

idk about adding methods to Array class in a real world enviorment
i just think its so neat 

i solved it, you were getting to saucy with it, 
with "clever code" its not so clear what is was going wrong
too saucy 

# want to drop the last 2 from the list 
stack = stack.reverse.drop(2) 
# i dont know how i forgot to reverse 
# it back 
stack = stack.reverse.drop(2).reverse 

anyways this is really slow reversing it 
twice 

i dont understand why this would not fail 
on first few cases then it would later on

reminder to first keep it very simple 

i have seen a object method that 
turns the operator string into the real operator
somewhere, could make it even shorter  

thinking about how we repeat 

stack.push ([value] [operator] [value])

in haskell you could probably do something very neatly with a function
data is imutable in haskell so idk about the stack push thing 

let stack = stack.push   (+,-,*,/) v1 v2


I did not realise i already solved this, i realised the
issue was division arithmetic a lot quicker than before.
The code I was writting was so bad lol, still is.
