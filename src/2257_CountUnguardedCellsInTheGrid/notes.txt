Wish i could
var grid [n][m]int
...

also tried to flatten array,
i can index to it correctly but don't
know how to save it into covered. Should come
back to this, this should be easy.

gave this code to deepseek

plus the code i wrote, and it one shot it.

The quality of the code is much better,
```Go

checkDirection := func(guardRow, guardCol int, rowStep, colStep int) {
    currentRow := guardRow + rowStep
    currentCol := guardCol + colStep
    
    for currentRow >= 0 && currentRow < m && currentCol >= 0 && currentCol < n {
        pos := currentRow*n + currentCol
        
        // Stop if we hit a wall or another guard
        if grid[pos] == 2 || grid[pos] == 1 {
            return
        }
        
        // Mark this position as covered
        covered[pos] = true
        
        // Move to next position in this direction
        currentRow += rowStep
        currentCol += colStep
    }
}
```

It is faster than my code,
my - (92ms - 133ms)
deepseek - (62ms)

figured creating one slice is better than
creating slices row by row.
but its still a lot slower than the fastest (30ms)

How did they do it?

Kinda cool i got to reuse code from LC. 999
