Pattern matching in scala is cool,
but it does not compare to haskell.

isOneBitCharacters [0]      = True
isOneBitCharacters [1,0]    = False
isOneBitCharacters [1,1]    = False
isOneBitCharacters (0:xs)   = isOneBitCharacters xs
isOneBitCharacters (1:_:xs) = isOneBitCharacters xs

isn't that so cool?
