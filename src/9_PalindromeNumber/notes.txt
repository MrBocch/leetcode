very new to rust so i dont understand several 
things about the language like this E0716 error 
my guess its something to do with ownership

seen other solutions in which they use math
to solve it instead of turning it into a string
i dont get it.

this is most like my ruby solution 

impl Solution {
    pub fn is_palindrome(x: i32) -> bool {
        x == x.to_string().chars().rev().collect::<String>().parse().unwrap_or(0)
    }
}

rust is nothing like what i have experience in
