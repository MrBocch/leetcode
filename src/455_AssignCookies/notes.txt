I remember skimming The Algorithm Design Manual
by Steven S. Skiena, and I read that they are 
certain problems that become trivial to solve 
if you sort the input first. I thought that was 
very interesting.

I been learning some haskell for a while 
so I asked my self how would i solve this 
in haskell or atleast in a functional manner

I have no idea. will come back to this
