I just now understand the
obj.method(&:method) syntax now. LOOL

I wonder if the ruby interpreter does this optimization
[1,2,3,4 ... n].sum()
to
(n * (n+1)) / 2
instead of
1 + 2 + 3 + .... n

only way to know is to compare speed difference

So it appears that it has some effect but its supper minimal
code......(1...v).sum : 31ms
code...gauss_sum(v-1) : 28ms
