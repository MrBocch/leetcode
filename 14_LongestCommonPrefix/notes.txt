Not proud of my solution,
struggled abit with traversing matrix.

I cant think of another method to solving this.

a small change could be
smallestString = (strs.sort_by {|s| s.length})[0].length-1   
dont theres much difference, probably slower?
knowing how .min{} implemented, whats happening under the hood 

If strs.length were much bigger than 200, what would happen?
