So off the jump did not expect the bruteforce method to work because the input 
can get quite big

> 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
> 1 <= t        <= 10^5

Imagine the worst case scenario. They obviously intended 
for a clever algorithm to be deployed here. What could it be?

Have a hashmap, with all the letters 
and count its freq at the start, apply a function
that applies the same rules, to calculate the new frequency.

at the end sum it all up?

Ok, tried that and it still does not work. 

The hint
"Maintain the frequency of each character" 
was not much help

Ok what if instead you calculated what 
'a' would turn into after 10 turns, but not from iteration 1 -> 2 -> 3 ....
but straight away?

we know that 
('a' 3) is (d : 1)
should try this
