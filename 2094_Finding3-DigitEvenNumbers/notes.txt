My permutation ruby solution is most likely correct
but its very slow.

constraints
3 <= digits.length <= 100

So imagine the worst case
digits.length = 100

how long would digits.permutation(3) get?

Very very big. if dig.size = 
6 -> 720 permutations
10 -> 3628800 permutations

Forget about it.
This will always always be very slow. 

Quicker data structures still wont 
save you, it did a little bit better but not much.

Generate the numbers some other way.
