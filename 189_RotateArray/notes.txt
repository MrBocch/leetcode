First found Time: O(n) solution but its not O(1) in space.
Also learned that you can map on Enumerators instead of
converting it into a array. Its a little bit faster but not by much.

The brute force solution is both, in place and O(1) space but its
O(n^2) time. It wont even pass the last 2 test cases.

How can we get the benefits of both solutions?
