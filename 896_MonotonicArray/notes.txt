is love this solution 

bool isMonotonic(int* nums, int size) {
    bool increasing = false, decreasing = false;
    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) increasing = true;
        if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) decreasing = true;
    }
    return !(increasing & decreasing);
}

i would of thought my C solution would of been much more faster but its not
