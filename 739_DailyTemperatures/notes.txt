I just could not figure out how how you were ment to
do the brute force O(n^2).

Figured its probably best to traverse array backwards on my own
but had to look peek at hint (monotonic stack) and go learn
what that is before writing this sloop.

How is this solution O(n)? You traverse array but also popping from
the stack which could also be the length of n ? this not an issue?

Know that I think about it, you could also probably use a
monotonic array for that other problem the Kth in a array?

Also this is the absolute slowest solution I did something wrong.
