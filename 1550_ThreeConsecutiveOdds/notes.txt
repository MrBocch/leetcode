I imagine can ultra optimize this by, 
lets say 
n_i is not odd, 
n_i+1 is not odd
n_i+2 is odd 

Instead of incrementing i+1, you increment by 2, knowing 
that the i+1 will be impossible.

I cant imagine it would that much faster. 
with a runtime less than 0ms, how can I see the performance gains?

The declarative solution feels like magic. 
Wish it had occured to me that I could call (.any?)
on the arr.each_cons()#Enumerable, first without needing
to look at someone elses code. Live and learn.
