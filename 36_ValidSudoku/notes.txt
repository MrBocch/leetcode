I always wondered when would using partial application
on a function ever be usefull.

The code is really ugly. It would be more clever to turn
every row/col into set.

What if instead you turn every cell (row, col, item) into
like a hashmap, then when you want to check if a sudoku is
valid you do a query on
items on row[0] -> 1 2 3 5 6 1
items on col[0] -> 1 7 8 2 3 4
what about the box's?
