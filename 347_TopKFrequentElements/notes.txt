The Counter() and .most_common() thing was really
cool but I wouldn't have known about it unless i saw the documentation
for Counter.

The bucket sort solution is really cool.
I have done the opposite where you have and array and
you index into with
freq[ord(char)] += 1
but the bucket sort thing is like the same but backwards.

but its slower. I figured maybe the Counter() thing is just implemented
in C but I dont think it is.
- https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/collections/__init__.py#L551
its a python class. and they are using heapq?

maybe my implementation is just slow
