My first leetcode medium

So this solution is O(n) time but also O(n) space

my first solution was actually

def majority_element(nums)
  return nums.filter{|n| nums.count(n) > nums.length/3}.uniq 
end

i believe this to be space complexity of zero if we use "!" at end of filter adn uniq
but its too slow, i think its due to nums.count()
