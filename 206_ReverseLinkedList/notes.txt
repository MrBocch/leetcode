Some very short time ago I tried to reverse a linked list in python for
what ever reason and I couldnt. That was so emberassing I decided that
I must come back to this to redeem my self.

I figured I must be able to reverse a linked list considering how much expierience one has and that once you learn it you can never forget.

This took me alot long that it should have. I dont code in C anymore but still.

So when i was doing this
```c
struct ListNode* temp = curr;
curr->next = prev;
prev = curr;
curr = temp->next;
```

This does will not work.

`temp` was also pointing to `curr`, it is not a copy.
