Thought of this problem when I was doing the bad apple thing in
armlite, wont get into it here.

I know you are ment to use two pointers
but i figured the functional solution would be so much cleaner.
Maybe its not "just cleaner" but i think in a more functional way.

Take A turn into B then into C then we have Answer.

The ruby solution would look so much more cleaner if
ruby had function pattern matching like elixir or haskell.
Should rewrite it just to see what it looks like.
