Thought of this problem when I was doing the bad apple thing in
armlite, wont get into it here.

I know you are ment to use two pointers
but i figured the functional solution would be so much cleaner.
Maybe its not "just cleaner" but i think in a more functional way.

Take A turn into B then into C then we have Answer.

The ruby solution would look so much more cleaner if
ruby had function pattern matching like elixir or haskell.
Should rewrite it just to see what it looks like.
Only realized this after the fact, but had i just written
the group function as a Array#reduce(), it would have been so much
more cleaner. oh well:(

Writing the go version, at one point the code got so bad
i just decided to rewrite half of it and i solved it in 3 minutes.
Sometimes you just have to step back and rethink it.

Im sure its more than possible to solve it with only one pass,
but i dont really like having to think about manipulating pointers
like that. it hurts my brain.
