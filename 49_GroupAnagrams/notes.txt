wish you could define the default value in a dictionary
*without* having to import anything like in ruby.

what is the time complexity?

O(n *(time to sort string?))

So i looked into it, a quicker method is to
instead of sorting the strings for the keys,
you can instead generate keys by using the
frequency of each letter into a 26 long array.
I tried it but it seems to be slower, my guess
is the allocating of list then turning it into a key
On big O notation it should be quicker but it
does not appear so (atleast in python)
