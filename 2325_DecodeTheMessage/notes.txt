simple substitution cipher

I just reliazed after the fact

if ord('z')+1 == curr:
    break

The idea is that if the key is longer than the alphabet
and the hashmap already has 'z' you can break out early.

I was looking at it ord('z')+1 evaluates to a number type
but curr is a String type. It will never evaluate to True.
Big fail interpreted languages (skill issue).

It would be more aesthetic if I just did not include that ;-;
